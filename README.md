# Refactoring / Replace Conditional With Polymorphism

Hey there! We're [thoughtbot](https://thoughtbot.com), a design and
development consultancy that brings your digital product ideas to life.
We also love to share what we learn.

This coding exercise comes from [Upcase](https://thoughtbot.com/upcase),
the online learning platform we run. It's part of the
[Refactoring](https://thoughtbot.com/upcase/refactoring) course and is just one small sample of all
the great material available on Upcase, so be sure to visit and check out the rest.

## Exercise Intro

Polymorphism allows us to have a single interface to handle entities of different types. In other words, we can send the same exact message to different objects and get different results in return.

In this exercise, you'll see that there's a method in the `PhonePlan` class that calculates the cost of a plan differently depending on its type. However, the class should only know how to retrieve the cost, not the details of how to calculate it. Let's extract some new classes to separate the concerns and hide those details.

## Instructions

To start, you'll want to clone and run the setup script for the repo

    git clone git@github.com:thoughtbot-upcase-exercises/replace-conditional-with-polymorphism.git
    cd replace-conditional-with-polymorphism
    bin/setup

Open up `lib/phone_plan.rb`. There you will see a single method named `cost`. Its corresponding tests are in `spec/lib/phone_plan_spec.rb`.

Replace the conditionals in `cost` with polymorphism. Each conditional should be represented by a new class, accompanied by their own tests.

When you're done, make sure that all the tests are passing by running:

    rake
